      <p>I am a keen web developer with several years of experience in both development and project management. After getting my placement year in a software company during university, my employer kept me on during my final year and post graduation.</p>

      <p>I currently live in China, having worked here for a few years, whilst also having worked in Australia and the UK.</p>
